CatBreedExplorer is a native Kotlin Multiplatform (Android and iOS) app that allows users to explore various cat breeds using TheCatAPI. The app provides a comprehensive list of cat breeds, including images, origins, and detailed information. Users can mark their favorite breeds, search for specific breeds, and even explore offline with locally stored data.

## Features

- **Breed List Screen:**
   - Display a list of cat breeds with images, names, and origins.
   - Additional information can be viewed for each breed.
   - Search bar to filter breeds by name.
   - Navigate to the Detail screen by selecting a breed.

- **Detail Screen:**
   - View detailed information for a selected breed, including image, name, origin, life span, temperament, and description.
   - Option to add/remove the breed from favorites.

- **Favorites Screen:**
   - List of favorite cat breeds.
   - Search bar to filter favorite breeds by name.
   - Navigate to the Detail screen by selecting a breed.

- **Offline Functionality:**
   - All data is cached locally, allowing the app to function offline.
   - Utilizes local storage to display information when there is no internet connection.

## Set up the environment

> **Warning**
> You need a Mac with macOS to write and run iOS-specific code on simulated or real devices.
> This is an Apple requirement.

To work with this template, you need the following:

* A machine running a recent version of macOS
* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* The [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)
* The [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-cocoapods.html)

### Check your environment

Before you start, use the [KDoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor) tool to ensure that your development environment is configured correctly:

1. Install KDoctor with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```text
    brew install kdoctor
    ```

2. Run KDoctor in your terminal:

    ```text
    kdoctor
    ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see valid output:

   ```text
   Environment diagnose (to see all details, use -v option):
   [‚úì] Operation System
   [‚úì] Java
   [‚úì] Android Studio
   [‚úì] Xcode
   [‚úì] Cocoapods
   
   Conclusion:
     ‚úì Your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development!
   ```

Otherwise, KDoctor will highlight which parts of your setup still need to be configured and will suggest a way to fix them.

## Usage

- Browse the list of cat breeds on the Breed List screen.
- Select a breed to view detailed information on the Detail screen.
- Add or remove breeds from favorites using the button provided.
- Explore your favorite breeds with the favorites filter on toolbar.
- Use the search bar to filter breeds by name on both the Breed List and Favorites screens.
